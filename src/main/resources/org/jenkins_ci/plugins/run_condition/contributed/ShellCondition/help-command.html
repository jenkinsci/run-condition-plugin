<div>
    Runs a shell script (defaults to sh, but this is configurable) for building the project.
    The script will be run with the workspace as the current directory.
    Type in the contents of your shell script. If your shell script has no header line like #!/bin/sh,
    then the shell configured system-wide will be used, but you can also use the header line to write
    script in another language (like #!/bin/perl) or control the options that shell uses.
    Default shell is the same as configured for the Execute shell build step.

    <p>
    By default, the shell will be invoked with the "-ex" option. So all of the commands are printed
    before being executed, and the build is considered a failure if any of the commands exits with
    a non-zero exit code. Again, add the #!/bin/... line to change this behavior.

    <p>
    As a best practice, try not to put a long shell script in here. Instead, consider adding the shell
    script in SCM and simply call that shell script from Jenkins (via bash -ex myscript.sh or something like that),
    so that you can track changes in your shell script.

    <p>
    A non-zero exit value will be treated as a false value
